# About us - WGTOTW
WGTOTW (We Gonna Take Over The World) is a large company and our main goal is to be of
service to as many as possible. We choose to do this through the creation of large scale 
forums. Websites that can be of use in as many areas of expertise as possible. We've chosen
to create this forum to be of service to the Smite community and to allow them to grow their
passion through discussion, as we grow ours by providing a useful service to others.

# About the site
This site, "Everything about SMITE", seeks to create a community based around the discussion
of everything SMITE related. Items, fan-art, and more. 

# About the developer

developed quality skills in HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL and Javascript. All these skills is shown
here on this site to some extent. Creating this site has been a tough and great experience,
a true opportunity for growth.
