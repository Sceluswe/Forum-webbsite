Find out why the "Why?" question is displayed when sorting by a tag that it doesn't have. I'm guessing
it's because the tag created contains two words "New Tag" it somehow messes with the prepared statement.

Make sure users can only update the score of a question once.
    1. Create a new column in question, answer and comment tables.
    2. Make sure it contains a string where each ID is split with a comma.
    3. When upvoting or downvoting, take the string from the database, check if the ID is there before
    making any changes. If it is, nothing happens, if it isn't a vote is placed.
    
    in_array('13', explode(',', '8,7,13,14,16'));
    Just to elaborate: explode turns the string into an array, splitting it at each ',' in this case. 
    Then, in_array checks if the string '13' is in the resulting array somewhere.
    
CommentController: Check if removeAllAction() should be removed. Could be a security risk.
CommentController: Check if setupAction() should be removed. Could be a security risk.

Design: Fix the design of the number in the score of the question. It looks unaligned.
Design: Display added tags below a posted question.
Design: Fix the design when displaying a user profile. The lightblue box should be aligned to the left.

ForumController: See if you can split it up into several controllers, one for tag one for... and so on.
ForumController.tagCreateAction($tag=null): Clean the $tag parameter with escaper.
ForumController.voteAction() clean the variable $number.
ForumController: Replace the cleaning of paramters with Escaper cleaning instead
ForumController: Potentially reduce size by splitting up answer, question and comment management into three new objects

ForumController & UserController: either add a class or find a way to move the renderDefaultPage() out
of ForumController so that both UserController and ForumController can use it.


User: Allow users to delete their own questions.

Fix: Remove all each() function errors. The function is deprecated.

-------- Completed --------
ForumController: Look over why ForumController.getTagForm($values) takes an array.
^ Because it needs one to autofill the values of the form.
Update the github readme file to include admin username and password so that users can log in.
Check if you can use the HTMLTable class to create the questions table: no
Create a class that creates tables easily.
Find out why the comments aren't displaying properly.
Replace if-statement at 223-240 in ForumController with a switch.
Add explaining comments to ForumController
Create one function: editVote that takes a number to edit the rating with instead of having the functions
downvote and upvote.
Turn downvoteAction() and upvoteAction() into one single function. It will require:
1. Providing a positive or negative 1 through the URL.
2. A safety check preventing anyone from injecting a number that's higher than 1 or lower than -1.
3. Creating 3 Q, A, C new redirects for the new function.
4. Editing forum-question.tpl.php to use the new redirect.

Edit lines 547-558 in ForumController to be a switch instead of if-statements.
commit changes in fixup as "add private ForumController.createRedirect()"
Removed: 'id' 	=> $id, from ForumController.upvote(). This line could create a bug where the
question, answer or comment changes ownership. Especially if the id is changed inside the URL.
