backlog

Make sure users can only update the score of a question once.
Fix the design of the number in the score of the question. It looks unaligned.
Allow users to delete their own questions.
Display added tags below a posted question.
Fix the design when displaying a user profile. The lightblue box should be aligned to the left.
Potentially split up answer, question and comment management into a three new objects to reduce
the size of ForumController.
Replace the cleaning of paramters inside ForumController with Escaper cleaning instead, as that is
much more thorough.
Update the github readme file to include admin username and password so that users can log in.
Remove all each() function errors. The function is deprecated.


-------- Completed --------
Removed: 'id' 	=> $id, from ForumController.upvote(). This line could create a bug where the
question, answer or comment changes ownership. Especially if the id is changed inside the URL.
